**Welcome to Unsung Anthem!**

Unsung Anthem is a 2D video game with own game engine. It is written by using modern C++ and functional programming paradigm.

## Values and Principles

The goal of Unsung Anthem is to be a game that embraces different styles of play and preferences of people. This will be strengthened by the storytelling of Unsung Anthem:

* Unsung Anthem is an open-air game.
* It can still be progressed somewhat linearly if the player wants to follow thin story.
* Player can discover a deeper story and lore hidden in the world, items, and dialogues of Unsung Anthem if they want to so the storytelling of Unsung Anthem resembles that of Dark Souls.

Unsung Anthem is supposed to be difficult and challenging but not punishing. Whenever the player does not overcome some challenge, they will not consistently blame the failure on Unsung Anthem but rather think how they could succeed by improving themselves.

The difficulty of Unsung Anthem will not be scalable by game settings. It will instead change according to player's decisions. For example, long-range combat could feel easier in some situations so the player chooses it instead of close-range combat. Still, Unsung Anthem maintains its combat system in such manner that players who choose to use more demanding styles of play will feel rewarded once they master the skill.

Also, one in-game solution, for example long-range combat, must not be viable in easing the player in every situation. The player has to find new and dissimilar strategies in different circumstances. The player will feel themselves clever for discovering these novel manoeuvres.

Unsung Anthem encourages the player to venture and look actively for new things to discover. The player will usually be rewarded for undertaking something risky and trying to uncover some secrets.

While Unsung Anthem is supposed to be challenging, writing it should not be. The code of Unsung Anthem follows clear and consistent rules for easier understanding of code. The code must always be well documented.
